# Decentralized Poker Smart Contract Project

A decentralized poker game implementation using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. This project implements a trustless, verifiable poker game where players can participate in Texas Hold'em matches with guaranteed fairness and transparency.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as a series of interconnected smart contracts that handle different aspects of a poker game, from deck management to game logic and prize distribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarity CLI
- Node.js and npm
- Stacks blockchain development environment

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poker-contract.git
cd poker-contract
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run tests:

npm test
```

## Development Status

### Completed:
- âœ… Card Deck Contract
  - Deck initialization
  - Card dealing
  - Status tracking
  - Security measures

### In Progress:
- ðŸ”„ Hand Evaluator Contract
- ðŸ”„ Game Flow Contract
- ðŸ”„ Prize Pool Management

### Planned:
- ðŸ“… Player Registration System
- ðŸ“… Tournament Support
- ðŸ“… Advanced Security Features

## Testing

Each contract component has its own test suite. To run tests for specific components:

```bash
npm run test:card-deck
npm run test:hand-evaluator
npm run test:game-flow
npm run test:prize-pool
```

## Security Considerations

- All critical functions are protected with appropriate access controls
- Random number generation uses blockchain-based entropy
- Anti-cheating mechanisms are implemented
- Timeout protection for player actions
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities
